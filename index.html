                <p class="note">This website is a cloud-based media management platform that allows users to upload photos, videos, and audio files. Once uploaded, the platform uses advanced search and indexing technologies—such as AI-based, audio transcription to make the content searchable. Users can quickly find specific files or moments within media by typing keywords, phrases, or tags. The service is ideal for researchers, and organizations that need to organize, access, and retrieve large amounts of multimedia efficiently. It often supports features like automatic metadata generation, tagging, and filtering by file type, date, or content.</p>
